Peopleâ€™s new yearâ€™s resolution starts to fade, as they came to realize that every year is basically the same except for the number on their calendar. So amidst all people that have given up their hope for this year, why, of all people, I am still very excited and hopeful for the things to come?",

Which is a lot really, especially when you donâ€™t have any income yet. Also, I have to deal with my thesis presentation (honestly, idk what to call it in English but what I mean is â€˜sidang skripsiâ€™) and the program as well.",
